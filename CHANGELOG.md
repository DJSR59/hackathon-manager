**Critical Breaking Change**

Old templates in `app/views/mailers` **must** be manually migrated into the new management UI. The existing automated emails will no longer function.

For each of these templates, create a new "Automated" message at `https://your-website.com/manage/messages`, set the appropriate trigger event, and copy their content over. Be sure to convert any Ruby/ERB code to static HTML as it is no longer supported.

* app/views/mailer/application_confirmation_email.html.erb
* app/views/mailer/denied_email.html.erb
* app/views/mailer/rsvp_confirmation_email.html.erb
